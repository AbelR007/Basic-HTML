# Basic-HTML

Want to learn or revise HTML5?
Then, Welcome to Basic-HTMl, where I post my simple but yet easy-to-understand conceptual html codes for everyone.
Many projects like the `LEARN THE BASiCS` by me has been added to [this Repository.](https://github.com/AbelR007/Basic-Python)

It's a great initiative by me to help everyone learn the basics including myself.
