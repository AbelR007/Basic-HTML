    <h1> Using Images & Links </h1>
    <h3> Links </h3>
    <p> Links can be used to help redirect and in accessibility. Starts with "a" <br>

      <a href="https://www.google.com/">Click this for Google :)</a>

      <h2>Relative URLs</h2>

      <a href="/css/styles.css">Shows CSS style page (which you most possibly cant access)</a>
    </p>

    <h3> Images </h3>
    <p> This is a random paragraph regarding random information. <br>
      The below image is Image with 100 height & width <br>
      <img src="python.png" alt="Python" width="100" height = "100"> <br>
      The below image is Image with Default width & height <br>
      <img src="python.png" alt="Python">
      <p>You can do a lot of stuff with images. Add styling as in width, height, ratio, and alt for alternate words.</p>
      <p>You can add animated images and also add links to an image just by adding an "a" tag outside the "img" tag.</p>
      <p> More tags : </p>
      <p>
        img :	For an image
        map :	For Image map
        area	: For a clickable area inside an image map
        picture :	For a container for multiple image resource</p>
      <p>Image MAPPING is a lot useful tool. USE IT WISELY.</p>
