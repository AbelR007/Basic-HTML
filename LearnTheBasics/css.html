    <h1> CSS in HTML </h1>
    <p> CSS controls the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used. </p>
    * BUT you have to LEARN CSS first.
    <h3> How to use CSS in HTML ?</h3>
    There are 3 ways to use CSS in HTML. They are :
    <ol>
      <li>1. Inline</li>
      <li>2. Internal</li>
      <li>3. External</li>
    </ol>
    <h4> Inline </h4>
    Inline uses the <code> style </code> attribute inside another tags.<br>
    It can be added to tag. Refer my LTB attributes file for more idea.
    <h4> Internal </h4>
    You can use <code> style </code> tag itself. And then, you can use CSS as you normally do. <br>
    Normally, this leads to a lot of confusion if you are creating a big, better site.
    <h4> External </h4>
    You can create a .css file and just link it in the index html file. <br>
    Use html "link" tag to make the job done.
    Example is shown below and is active if you are reading from the site itself.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css_eg.css">
    <h2> As I said before, LEARN CSS to be good in styling web pages.</h2>
